# Updated Database Migration Instructions

## Problem: Policy Conflict Error

You're experiencing a policy conflict error when trying to apply the migration. The error message indicates that a policy named "projects_user_access_20250702" already exists for the "projects" table.

## Solution: Apply the Updated Migration

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Updated Migration
Copy and paste this SQL into the SQL Editor and click **RUN**:

```sql
-- Function to safely drop a policy if it exists
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION drop_policy_if_exists(policy_name text, table_name text)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies 
    WHERE policyname = policy_name AND tablename = table_name
  ) THEN
    EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY %I ON %I', policy_name, table_name);
    RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped existing policy: % on table %', policy_name, table_name;
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'Policy % on table % does not exist, skipping', policy_name, table_name;
  END IF;
END;

### Step 3: Verify Success
After running the migration, you should see:
- âœ… No error messages
- âœ… "Success" message or similar confirmation

### Step 4: Test the App
1. Refresh your application
2. Sign in
3. Try to delete a project
4. The connection timeout error should be resolved

## What This Migration Does:

### ðŸ”„ **Fixes Policy Conflicts**
- Safely removes any existing policies that might conflict
- Creates new policies with unique names to avoid collisions

### ðŸ”’ **Enhances Security**
- Creates specific policies for deletion operations
- Ensures users can only delete their own projects

### ðŸš€ **Improves Performance**
- Ensures the safe deletion function exists
- Properly handles related assets and layers

## If You Still Have Issues:

1. **Check the browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Try signing out and back in** to refresh your session
3. **Clear your browser cache** and local storage
4. **Contact support** with any specific error messages you see
