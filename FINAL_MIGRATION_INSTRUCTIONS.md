# Final Database Migration Instructions

## Problem: Connection Timeout Error When Deleting Projects

You're experiencing a connection timeout error when trying to delete projects. This happens because:
1. There are policy conflicts in the database
2. The cascade deletion operations are failing
3. Previous migrations have created conflicting policies

## Solution: Apply the Final Migration

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Final Migration
Copy and paste this SQL into the SQL Editor and click **RUN**:

```sql

### Step 3: Verify Success
After running the migration, you should see:
- âœ… No error messages
- âœ… "Success" message or similar confirmation

### Step 4: Test the App
1. Refresh your application
2. Sign in
3. Try to delete a project
4. The connection timeout error should be resolved

## What This Migration Does:

### ðŸ§¹ **Complete Policy Cleanup**
- Removes ALL existing policies to avoid conflicts
- Creates new, simpler policies with unique names
- Separates policies by operation type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### ðŸ”’ **Enhanced Security**
- Users can only see and modify their own projects
- Legacy data (without created_by) remains accessible
- Proper ownership checks for all operations

### ðŸš€ **Improved Performance**
- Robust project deletion function with error handling
- Proper cascade deletion of related assets and layers
- Continues deletion even if some related items fail

### ðŸ”§ **Error Handling**
- Better error messages for troubleshooting
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Proper transaction management

## If You Still Have Issues:

1. **Check the browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Try signing out and back in** to refresh your session
3. **Clear your browser cache** and local storage
4. **Contact support** with any specific error messages you see

## Why This Approach Works:

This migration takes a "clean slate" approach by removing all existing policies and creating new ones with unique names. This avoids any conflicts with previous migrations and ensures a consistent security model.

The safe_delete_project function provides a robust way to delete projects and their related assets and layers, with proper error handling to prevent connection timeouts.
