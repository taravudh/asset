PERMANENT DATABASE CONNECTION FIX INSTRUCTIONS

You're experiencing a database connection error when trying to delete projects or perform other operations. This is happening because of policy conflicts and missing columns in the database.

To permanently fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard (https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to SQL Editor in the left sidebar
4. Copy and paste the SQL from the FINAL_SQL_FIX.sql file
5. Click RUN

This SQL script will:
- Remove all conflicting policies
- Add any missing columns
- Create new, permissive policies that will allow the app to work
- Create a robust project deletion function
- Update existing data to ensure it's properly associated with users

After running the script:
1. Refresh your application
2. Sign in
3. Try to delete a project
4. The connection timeout error should be resolved

IMPORTANT: This fix uses temporarily permissive policies to ensure the app works. Once everything is working correctly, you may want to apply more restrictive policies for better security.

If you still experience issues:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Try signing out and back in to refresh your session
3. Clear your browser cache and local storage
4. Contact support with any specific error messages you see
