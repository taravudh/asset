# Admin Roles Database Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up proper admin roles in your Asset Survey application database.

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema Overview

The admin role system consists of several interconnected tables:

### Core Tables

1. **`user_roles`** - Defines available roles (admin, user, etc.)
2. **`user_permissions`** - Defines granular permissions 
3. **`role_permissions`** - Links roles to permissions
4. **`user_role_assignments`** - Assigns roles to users
5. **`audit_logs`** - Tracks admin actions for security

### Default Roles Created

- **`super_admin`** - Full system access with all permissions
- **`admin`** - Administrative access to manage users and organizations  
- **`project_manager`** - Can manage projects and assets within organizations
- **`user`** - Basic user with access to assigned projects

### Default Permissions Categories

- **User Management** - Create, update, delete users and assign roles
- **Organization Management** - Manage organizations and memberships
- **Project Management** - Manage projects and assets
- **System Administration** - System settings and audit logs
- **Data Management** - Import/export and backup operations

## üöÄ Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Run the Database Migration

The migration file `20250629080000_admin_roles_system.sql` will:
- Create all necessary tables
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Insert default roles and permissions
- Create helper functions for role checking

### 2. Create Your First Admin User

You have several options:

#### Option A: Through the Application UI
1. Sign up with an email containing "admin" (e.g., `admin@company.com`)
2. The system will automatically detect admin status
3. Use the Admin Dashboard to assign proper roles

#### Option B: Using the Database Functions
```sql
-- First, get the user ID from auth.users
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@company.com';

-- Then assign the super_admin role
SELECT assign_user_role(
  'user-id-here'::uuid, 
  'super_admin'
);
```

#### Option C: Using the CreateAdminUser Component
The application includes a `CreateAdminUser` component that can be used to create admin accounts programmatically.

### 3. Verify Admin Access

Once you have an admin user:
1. Sign in with the admin account
2. You should see a purple admin badge in the user menu
3. Click "Admin Dashboard" to access admin features
4. Verify you can see the User Management section

## üîê Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with policies that:
- Only allow admins to manage users and roles
- Users can only see their own role assignments
- Audit logs are only visible to administrators

### Permission Checking
The system includes helper functions:
- `has_role(user_id, role_name)` - Check if user has specific role
- `has_permission(user_id, permission_name)` - Check if user has permission
- `get_user_roles(user_id)` - Get all roles for a user
- `get_user_permissions(user_id)` - Get all permissions for a user

### Audit Logging
All admin actions are automatically logged with:
- User who performed the action
- Action type and target resource
- Timestamp and additional details
- IP address and user agent (when available)

## üõ†Ô∏è Managing Roles and Permissions

### Adding New Roles
```sql
INSERT INTO user_roles (name, display_name, description) 
VALUES ('custom_role', 'Custom Role', 'Description of the role');
```

### Adding New Permissions
```sql
INSERT INTO user_permissions (name, display_name, description, category) 
VALUES ('custom_permission', 'Custom Permission', 'Description', 'category_name');
```

### Linking Roles to Permissions
```sql
INSERT INTO role_permissions (role_id, permission_id)
SELECT r.id, p.id 
FROM user_roles r, user_permissions p 
WHERE r.name = 'role_name' AND p.name = 'permission_name';
```

### Assigning Roles to Users
```sql
-- Using the helper function (recommended)
SELECT assign_user_role('user-id'::uuid, 'role_name');

-- Or direct insert
INSERT INTO user_role_assignments (user_id, role_id, assigned_by)
SELECT 'user-id'::uuid, r.id, auth.uid()
FROM user_roles r WHERE r.name = 'role_name';
```

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### View Current Role Assignments
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  r.display_name as role,
  ura.assigned_at,
  ura.expires_at
FROM auth.users u
JOIN user_role_assignments ura ON u.id = ura.user_id
JOIN user_roles r ON ura.role_id = r.id
WHERE ura.is_active = true
ORDER BY u.email, ura.assigned_at;
```

### Check User Permissions
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_user_permissions('user-id'::uuid);
```

### View Audit Logs
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  al.action,
  al.resource_type,
  al.details,
  al.created_at
FROM audit_logs al
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON al.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY al.created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Access Denied" when trying to access admin features**
   - Verify the user has the correct role assigned
   - Check that the role is active and not expired
   - Ensure RLS policies are properly set up

2. **Functions not found errors**
   - Make sure the migration ran successfully
   - Check that functions were created with proper permissions
   - Verify the user has EXECUTE permissions on functions

3. **Permission denied on tables**
   - Ensure RLS policies are correctly configured
   - Check that the user is authenticated
   - Verify role assignments are active

### Useful Queries for Debugging

```sql
-- Check if user has specific role
SELECT has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin');

-- Check if user has specific permission  
SELECT has_permission(auth.uid(), 'manage_users');

-- View all roles for current user
SELECT * FROM get_user_roles(auth.uid());

-- View all permissions for current user
SELECT * FROM get_user_permissions(auth.uid());
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Only assign the minimum permissions needed
2. **Regular Audits** - Review role assignments and audit logs regularly
3. **Role Expiration** - Use expiration dates for temporary access
4. **Backup Admin Access** - Always maintain at least one super_admin account
5. **Monitor Activity** - Regularly check audit logs for suspicious activity

## üìù Next Steps

After setting up the admin role system:

1. Create your admin users
2. Configure organization-specific permissions
3. Set up project-level access controls
4. Implement data export/import workflows
5. Configure backup and monitoring procedures
