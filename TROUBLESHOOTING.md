# ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Database Issues

## Current Error: "Could not find the 'created_by' column"

This error indicates that the database migration hasn't been applied yet. Here are the steps to resolve it:

### Option 1: Apply the Migration (Recommended)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Select your project
   - Go to **SQL Editor**

2. **Run this SQL migration:**

```sql
-- Add created_by column to projects table
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Add created_by column to assets table  
ALTER TABLE assets ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Add created_by column to layers table
ALTER TABLE layers ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_projects_created_by ON projects(created_by);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assets_created_by ON assets(created_by);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_layers_created_by ON layers(created_by);

-- Update existing projects to belong to the first user
UPDATE projects SET created_by = (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1) WHERE created_by IS NULL;
UPDATE assets SET created_by = (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1) WHERE created_by IS NULL;
UPDATE layers SET created_by = (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1) WHERE created_by IS NULL;
```

3. **Click RUN**

4. **Refresh your app**

### Option 2: Temporary Fix (If migration fails)

The app has been updated with fallback logic that will:
- âœ… Try to use the `created_by` column if it exists
- âœ… Fall back to working without it if the column doesn't exist
- âœ… Show better error messages

### Option 3: Reset Database (Nuclear option)

If nothing else works:

1. Go to **Settings â†’ General** in Supabase
2. Scroll down to **Reset Database**
3. This will delete all data but fix schema issues
4. You'll need to recreate your projects

### What Should Happen After Fix:

âœ… **No more "created_by" errors**
âœ… **See your existing projects in a beautiful grid**
âœ… **Projects persist between sessions**
âœ… **Proper user data isolation**

### If You Still See Errors:

1. **Check browser console** for detailed error messages
2. **Try signing out and back in**
3. **Clear browser cache/localStorage**
4. **Check Supabase project status** in dashboard

### Alternative: Use Without Database

If you want to test the app without database:
1. The app will work in "demo mode"
2. Projects won't persist between sessions
3. No user authentication required
4. All features work except data persistence
