  # Fix RLS Policy Infinite Recursion

  1. Problem
    - The existing policies create circular references when checking permissions
    - organization_members policies reference themselves through role checking
    - This causes infinite recursion errors

  2. Solution
    - Simplify RLS policies to avoid circular references
    - Use direct user ID checks instead of complex role lookups
    - Create separate policies for different access patterns

  3. Changes
    - Drop problematic policies
    - Create simplified, non-recursive policies
    - Ensure admin access without circular dependencies
