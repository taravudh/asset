/*
  # Fix Project Deletion Connection Error

  This migration specifically addresses the connection error that occurs when deleting projects.
  The issue is likely related to cascade deletion policies and foreign key constraints.

  1. Problem Analysis
    - Project deletion triggers cascade delete on assets and layers
    - RLS policies might be blocking the cascade operations
    - Foreign key constraints need proper policy support

  2. Solution
    - Create deletion-specific policies that allow cascade operations
    - Ensure proper permissions for related table operations
    - Add error handling for deletion operations

  3. Changes
    - Add cascade-friendly policies
    - Create safe deletion function
    - Ensure proper cleanup of related data
