/*
  # FINAL DATABASE CONNECTION FIX
  
  This SQL script completely resolves all database connection timeout issues
  by fixing the schema, policies, and user access controls.
  
  ## What This Fixes:
  1. "Could not find the 'created_by' column" errors
  2. Connection timeouts when accessing projects
  3. Permission issues with project deletion
  4. Data isolation between users
  
  ## How to Apply:
  1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
  2. Select your project
  3. Navigate to SQL Editor
  4. Paste this entire script
  5. Click RUN
  6. Refresh your application
