/*
  # Fix Project Deletion Connection Error
  
  This migration resolves the connection timeout error when deleting projects
  by using a completely different approach that avoids policy conflicts.
  
  1. Problem Analysis
    - Previous migrations created conflicting policies
    - Connection timeout occurs during project deletion
    - Cascade delete operations are failing
  
  2. Solution
    - Use a clean-slate approach with unique policy names
    - Create a robust project deletion function
    - Add specific policies for deletion operations
    - Ensure proper error handling
